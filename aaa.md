	I don't have any friends if you watch my videos, you might realize that I do a lot of things alone, that's because I don't have any friends and I have made peace with that. I think a lot of people might be able to relate to me. It’s not that I’m not a good person and I am really easy to get along with. It's just that I don't have any friends or the friends that I do have, they're nowhere near me. And also as you get older, it becomes much harder to make long lasting friendships, to be honest, I do sometimes get jealous of girls who have a huge friend groups and go out and do things with each other all the time. But the more time I spend alone, the more I realize that I am really capable of doing anything. And I can be the source of my own happiness and I don't need to rely on other people to give it to me.
	I had a really close friend group a few years ago, but I turned toxic so fast. I would always want to be with them because when I was alone I felt so lonely, it got to the point where I couldn't eat without them, I couldn't go anywhere without them, and at some point, I just felt totally lost and I started isolating myself, which is when I realized that friendships can actually cause so much pain. Sometimes, even when I am in a group of people, it makes me feel worse, because I never feel like I really fit in. And I feel pressure to be something that I am not, of course there are healthy friendships and that can be a very beautiful thing. But I think it's good to be okay with being alone as well.
	honestly, now that I don't have any friends, I feel more independent and stress free. And I feel like I can do whatever I want. In the past I would always ask people what they want to do, like if I wanted to see a movie, i would ask someone if they wanted to come with me see a movie. Well, they might say no, or they might suggest a different movie instead, and then eventually I would not see the movie that I wanted to see, so this kind of thing made me miss out on a lot of experiences that I really wanted to have. now if I want to see a movie, I can just go. And I'm still gonna have a good time. because I am doing it with someone I like, myself.
	Doing things alone might seem scary for people who are used to having the crunch of other people around them all the time, but once you let go of the fear and embarrassment that you might feel. you start to realize and learn so much about yourself. You'll realize that you really can do anything, and it doesn't matter what other people say or think about you. Because you're living your life, I'm not saying that you should cut off all your friends, but I am saying if you don't have many friends, it's OK. And a lot of people have the same experience as you, and also I encourage you to get out of comfort zone and try doing some things independently. because you will see a new confidence and improved version of yourself. 

1. independently
   * 修饰动词
     用于描述动作是独立进行的，没有依赖他人或其他事物。比如：“She completed the project independently.（她独立完成了这个项目。）”，在这句话中，“independently”修饰动词“completed”，表明“完成项目”这个动作是她自己独立完成的，没有借助外部过多的帮助。
   * 修饰形容词或副词
     在一些比较级结构等情况中，用来加强“独立”的程度。例如：“This region is more independently developed than others.（这个地区比其他地区发展得更独立。）”，“independently”修饰形容词“developed”，突出发展过程中的自主性。
