# 我没有朋友但我过的很爽

       I don't have any friends if you watch my videos, you might realize that I do a lot of things alone, that's because I don't have any friends and I’ve made peace with that. I think a lot of people might be able to relate to me. It’s not that I’m not a good person and I am really easy to get along with. It's just that I don't have any friends or the friends that I do have, they're nowhere near me. And also as you get older, it becomes much harder to make long lasting friendships, To be honest, I do sometimes get jealous of girls who have huge friend groups and go out and do things with each other all the time. But the more time I spend alone, the more I realize that I am really capable of doing anything. And I can be the source of my own happiness and I don't need to rely on other people to give it to me.

* make pease with sth 	与什么和解
  * I finally made peace with that after a long argument.”（在长时间的争论之后，我最终和那件事达成了和解。）
* I think a lot of people might be able to relate to me.
  * “might be able to”：是情态动词短语，在这里作谓语动词的一部分。“might”是情态动词，表示可能性，意为“可能，也许”，语气相对较弱；“be able to”表示“能够”，有“具备某种能力去做某事”的含义，二者结合起来表达一种推测的、有一定可能性的能力。
  * “relate to”：是一个动词短语，意思是“与……有关联；**与……产生共鸣**；理解”等，在这里根据语境可理解为“与……产生共鸣”。
* get along with  与什么相处
* it's not that   并不是说，引导一个表语从句
* “nowhere near”是一个常用短语，在这里作表语，其中“nowhere”表示“无处；哪里都不”，“near”表示“靠近；在……附近”，合起来就是“离……远；根本不在……附近”的意思
* make long lasting friendships.   建立长久的友谊
* make a long lasting friendship.  建立一个长久的友谊
* have huge friend groups.   有很多朋友圈
* have a huge group of friends.   有一个很大的朋友圈
* But the more time I spend alone, the more I realize that I am really capable of doing anything.
  * I spend alone. 我独自度过
  * “capable”是形容词，意思是“有能力的；有才能的”，常用搭配是“be capable of doing sth.”，表示“有能力做某事”
* the source of my own happiness. 我自己的幸福源泉  

  I had a really close friend group ==🟢a few years ago==, but I turned toxic so fast. I would always want to be with them because when I was alone I felt so lonely, it got to the point where I couldn't eat without them, I couldn't go anywhere without them, and at some point, I just felt totally lost and I started isolating myself, which is when I realized that friendships can actually cause so much pain. Sometimes, even when I am in a group of people, it makes me feel worse, because I never feel like I really fit in. And I feel pressure to be something that I am not, of course there are healthy friendships and that can be a very beautiful thing. But I think it's good to be okay with being alone as well.

1. but I turned toxic so fast [/ˈtɑːksɪk/](cmd://Speak/_us_/toxic)
   * 但我很快就变得有害（负面、糟糕）起来了。
     这里“toxic”常见意思是“有毒的”，在形容人或人的情绪、行为等时，可引申为“有害的、负面的、糟糕的”等类似意思。例如形容一段关系变得很糟糕，也可以说“The relationship turned toxic.”。
2. I feel so lonely. 我感觉很孤独
3. it got to the point where...”这个结构里，“it”指代前文提到的某种情况、事态等，整体意思是“（情况、事态等）发展到了……的地步”，和“明白”这个意思不同哦。在这里“get”是“达到、发展到”的含义，比如：It got to the point where we had to make a decision.（情况发展到了我们必须做决定的地步。）
4. and at some point, I just felt totally lost and I started isolating myself
   * **I just feel totally lost.** 我感觉完全迷失了方向
   * isolate.  [/ˈaɪsəleɪt/](cmd://Speak/_us_/isolate) 孤立  这里用到了start doing sth. 表示开始做某事，有储蓄下去的意思，而start to do sth. 也是开始做某事，含有即将开始做某事的意思
5. which is when I realized that friendships can actually cause so much pain.
   * 这里的which引导了一个非限制性定语从句，表示前面所提到的（一个特殊的时刻或者经历）
   * is when 表示就是……..的时候
* Sometimes, even when I am in a group of people, it makes me feel worse, because I never feel like I really fit in.
  * 这是一个主从复合句，包含一个主句和两个从句，其中一个是时间状语从句，另一个是原因状语从句。
  * even when 是一个复合引导词，在这里引导时间状语从句，表示强调在某种特定的时间情况下，“even”起到加强语气的作用，意思是“即使；哪怕”。
  * fit in.  适应，融入
  
* worse 是bad 的比较级。bad worse worst
  * 比较级：This situation is worse than the last one.（这种情况比上一种更糟。）

* “more”是“many”（修饰可数名词复数）和“much”（修饰不可数名词）的比较级，意思是“更多的”。例如：
  * I have more books than you.（我有的书比你多。）这里“more books”相当于“more +可数名词复数”，和“many books”比较，是“更多的书”的意思。
  * He drinks more water than his sister.（他喝的水比他妹妹多。）“more water”即“more+不可数名词”，和“much water”比较，是“更多的水”的意思。
* 比较级的使用
  * 与“than”连用，表示“比……更” 这是比较级最常见的用法，用于两个人或事物之间的比较。
    * 例如：My sister is taller than me.（我姐姐/妹妹比我高。）
  * 用“比较级 + and + 比较级”结构，表示“越来越……”
    * 例如：It's getting colder and colder.（天气变得越来越冷。）
  * “the + 比较级，the + 比较级”结构，表示“越……，就越……”
    * 例如：The more you practice, the better you will get.（你练习得越多，就会变得越好。）
  * 比较级用于修饰某些词，表示“稍微；更……一点”
    * 例如：Could you speak a little louder?（你能稍微大声一点说话吗？）这里“louder”是“loud”的比较级，没有和“than”连用，只是表达“更响亮一点”的意思。
* I feel pressure to be something that I am not. 我感受到要成为一个并非真实自己的那种压力。
  * “To be something”常见的翻译有“成为某物；成为某种人；成为某种样子”等。例如：

  honestly, now that I don't have any friends, I feel more independent and stress free. And I feel like I can do whatever I want. In the past I would always ask people what they want to do, like if I wanted to see a movie, i would ask someone if they wanted to come with me see a movie. Well, they might say no, or they might suggest a different movie instead, and then eventually I would not see the movie that I wanted to see, so this kind of thing made me miss out on a lot of experiences that I really wanted to have. now if I want to see a movie, I can just go. And I'm still gonna have a good time. because I am doing it with someone I like, myself.

  * honestly, now that I don't have any friends。说实话，既然我没有任何朋友
    * now that是一个引导词，引导原因状语从句，意思是“既然，由于”
  * “stress free”是形容词短语，意思是“没有压力的，无压力的”。例如：I had a stress free weekend.（我度过了一个没有压力的周末。）
  * In the past I would always ask people what they want to do
    * “would + 动词原形”（would ask）是一种过去常常做某事的表达结构，用于描述过去的习惯性动作。
  * come with me 跟我来，和我一起去
  * so this kind of thing made me miss out on a lot of experiences that I really wanted to have
    * “make sb. do sth.”是固定用法，意为“使某人做某事”，这里“miss out on”表示“错过，错失（机会等）”。
    * miss out”，它主要侧重于“遗漏、省略”的意思。例如，“You can miss out this paragraph when you read.（你阅读的时候可以跳过这一段。）”而“miss out on”更强调错过了得到或享受某事物的机会。例如，“Don't miss out on the concert.（别错过这场音乐会。）”
  Doing things alone might seem scary for people who are used to having the crunch of other people around them all the time, but once you let go of the fear and embarrassment that you might feel. you start to realize and learn so much about yourself. You'll realize that you really can do anything, and it doesn't matter what other people say or think about you. Because you're living your life, I'm not saying that you should cut off all your friends, but I am saying if you don't have many friends, it's OK. And a lot of people have the same experience as you, and also I encourage you to get out of comfort zone and try doing some things independently. because you will see a new confidence and improved version of yourself. 
* be used to
  * 当表示“习惯于”的意思时，它后面需要接名词、代词或动名词（动词 -ing形式）。例如：“I am used to the noise.（我习惯了这种噪音。）”“He is used to getting up early.（他习惯早起。）”
