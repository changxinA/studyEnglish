​	I'm a huge introvert, but i think a lot of people have a misconception of what an introvert truly is. when I say I'm an introvert, a lot of people might jump to conclusions and think antisocial or someone who doesn't like people, but this is really not true. actually, a lot of Americans are very introverted, but we're also pretty polite and nice. so some people might confused this with being outgoing, but that's just a stereotype. and also sometimes I feel like when people think of me，"you need to be more outgoing". they'd force themselves to be outgoing, but i really don't think this is necessary. I think just being polite and nice and caring and treating others with respect is really all you need and you also won't get exhausted from trying to be something that you're not. but being introverted doesn't mean that I can't socialize or make friends and humans are very multifaceted.

​		I know a lot of people have classified themselves as introverts, so they feel like that means they have to live in the way the public views "introverts". I think in the past i was also confused by myself. because I would normally be really shy and quiet in most situations. but if i was around my close friends, then i could be super wild and i love to make other people laugh. and being an introvert doesn't mean i don't like people or I'm antisocial or something like that. that's really not the case at all. I just get my energy from spending time alone. so in my alone time i feel more recharged and being around people can feel really draining. spending time with others for a shorter period of time is great, but for a longer periods of time i do start to feel a bit exhausted. as a result of this, i do spend a lot of time alone, but being alone doesn't have to mean being lonely. I really enjoy my time alone. I don't feel any pressure to socialize and i don't feel like i have to force myself to be a certain way, be outgoing so more people will like me.

​		I think society paints being alone or spending time alone as a kind of weird thing, and as a result of this, some people feel weird or awkward going out to eat or going to the movies alone, but this can actually hold us back from really enjoying our lives. we don't need to wait for other people to have free time, to go and do something that we want to do. if I want to try something new or go somewhere, I don't need to rely on other people. I can just go myself. for me, being alone means being able to enjoy my life on my terms. It has(It's) helped me gain more independence and also feel more confident.

1. I think society paints being alone or spending time alone as a kind of weird thing

​	I used to be really anxious going out and doing things alone. I felt scared that other people were watching me and judging me for being alone. but honestly, nobody cares what you're doing. every time i say i enjoy spending time alone, there will always be someone arguing with me and saying:"you have a boyfriend“, but having a partner is way different from having friends, and it wouldn't be a healthy relationship. If i relied on my boyfriend for all of my happiness, I still spend most of my time alone because that's what I like. this is my choice and my boyfriend and i also have very different hobbies, so we do things together. but i also don't want to drag him around and do things that he has no interest in. so sometimes if i want to go watch a movie, if i want to go do something, i can just do it myself and i don't need to feel like i have to wait for him or I have to force him to go and do something with me.

1. anxious 焦虑
2. nobody cares what you're doing
   1. nobody  没有人 也是第三人称单数

3. There will always be someone arguing with me and saying...” 这个句子中使用 “arguing” 和 “saying” 的 “ing” 形式，是因为这里运用了 “there be + 名词 + doing sth.” 的结构。表示 “存在；有”
4. but having a partner is way different from having friends
   1. **“way”**：在这里是副词，意思是 “非常；远远地；大大地”，用来修饰形容词 “different”，强调 “有伴侣” 和 “有朋友” 之间的差异程度很大。
   2. **在口语中，“way” 还可表示 “很；非常”**：相当于 “very”，用于修饰形容词原级。例如：It's way cool!（太酷了！）

5. it wouldn't be a healthy relationship. If i relied on my boyfriend for all of my happiness
   1. **“relied on”**：是谓语动词短语，“rely on” 意为 “依赖；依靠”，“relied” 是 “rely” 的过去式，这里使用一般过去时是因为在虚拟条件句中，与现在事实相反的假设，从句通常用一般过去时（be 动词一般用 were）。

6.  but i also don't want to drag him around and do things that he has no interest in.
   1. “drag sb. around” 是一个动词短语，意思是 “带着某人四处奔波；拉着某人到处走”，在这里是 “want to” 后面并列的第一个动作

​	and when i say i don't have many friends, a lot of people will say "How can nobody want her". Some people have a habit of judging a girl's value by how much attention and approval she gets from other boys, and even attach their own value to what their friends think of them, not having many friends does not mean not having a single friend at all. It's just that i don't like to take the initiative to make friends, and at the same time, I also feel like myself worth comes from myself and not from other people. and I'm also just the kind of person who really needs alone time. I think the key point for really enjoying being alone and spending time alone is actually liking yourself. so i feel fine being alone. I enjoy spending my time alone because i like who i am and i like being able to be creative and work on my hobbies without feeling like other people next to me are judging me or watching me.

1. attention and approval	分别表示 “关注” 和 “认可”。
2. and even attach their own value to what their friends think of them,

   2. “think of” 是从句中的谓语动词短语，意为 “对…… 有某种看法；评价”。
3. “to take the initiative” 表示 “采取主动；主动做某事”，其中 “take the initiative” 是固定短语；“
4. and I'm also just the kind of person
   1. **“just”**：也是副词，作状语，意为 “正好；恰好；仅仅”，进一步强调 “the kind of person”，突出说话者所描述的自身特点。
5. i like who i am 我喜欢我自己
   1. who i am 我是谁，我是怎样的人
   2. who you are 你本来的样子
6. i like being able to be creative and work on my hobbies 
   1. “work on” 是动词短语，意为 “致力于；从事于”
   2. “creative” 是形容词，意为 “有创造力的；创造性的”。要表达 “处于有创造力的状态”“变得有创造力” 这样的含义时，需要借助系动词 “be” 来连接形容词 “creative”，因为系动词后面可以接形容词作表语。
7.  other people next to me
   1. **“next to me”**：是介词短语作后置定语，修饰 “other people”，说明这些人是 “在我旁边的”。

​	one of my hobbies is that I love making videos. some people might be thinking "if you were a true introvert, you wouldn't be able to make these videos", but that's totally not true. being an introvert doesn't mean i can't make videos and it also took me a really long time. it took me years to feel comfortable in front of the camera like this. this is still something that I'm doing totally alone and this creative process is also really important for me. if there were someone in the room with me right now, that would be a totally different story. I would feel really awkward and embarrassed and i wouldn't be able to say a single word. so just because you're an introvert, it doesn't mean you have to confine yourself to this box and if you have dreams of doing something, you should just go do it and don't let this hold you back. I don't think being an introvert is a bad thing. It's just who you are and there are plenty of good things about being an introvert that nobody talks about. and at the end of the day, life is about creating your own happiness and finding things that bring you joy. when you stop caring about what other people think and you're able to fully enjoy being alone with yourself, you'll start to become more independent and truly happy with who you are. 

1.  it took me years 花费了我好几年
2. “awkward” 和 “embarrassed” 都有 “尴尬” 的意思，但在语义和使用上存在一些细微差别：
   - 含义侧重
     - “awkward” 更强调因不自然、不熟练或缺乏技巧而导致的尴尬局面，常暗示一种笨拙、不灵活的状态。比如，一个人在社交场合中不知道如何与人交流，举止生硬，就可以用 “awkward” 来形容。
     - “embarrassed” 则侧重于因害羞、难堪或担心被他人评判而产生的尴尬情绪，通常与个人的自尊心受到影响有关。例如，当一个人在公众场合被指出错误时，会感到 “embarrassed”。
   - 使用场景
     - “awkward” 可用于描述各种因不适当、不合适而引起的尴尬情况，不仅限于人的感受，还可以形容场景、气氛等。例如：“There was an awkward silence in the room.”（房间里出现了一阵尴尬的沉默。）
     - “embarrassed” 主要用于形容人自身的尴尬感受，较少用于形容事物。比如：“She was embarrassed by his compliment.”（她因他的赞美而感到尴尬。）
   - 程度差异
     - “awkward” 所表达的尴尬程度相对较轻，更多的是一种不太自在的感觉。
     - “embarrassed” 所表达的尴尬程度通常较重，往往伴随着面红耳赤、心跳加速等生理反应，是一种更强烈的情感体验。
3. **confine** 限制，限定
4. “have dreams of doing something” 表示 “有做某事的梦想”。
