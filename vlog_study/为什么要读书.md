# 为什么要读书

I totally understand people who feel this way because reading a book does take a lot of time and energy, and it's really normal to not remember everything you read, but i don't think the point is to remember everything, i think the point is just to enjoy the process, i mean, people who like watching sports also don't remember every single moment of a game, they probably only remember who won or if there was something really amazing that happened in the game.
* every single moment of a game 游戏中的每一刻
  * every single moment of my childhood 我童年的每一个瞬间
  * every single moment of out time together 我们在一起的每一个瞬间
  * every single moment of the journey  旅途的每一个瞬间

i just enjoy being totally immersed in a book.i think there's this common misconception that reading is the super academic thing, which of course,it totally can be.there are a lot of classics to learn from, but there are also many other genres like romance, mystery, fantasy or literally anything else that you can read just for fun.	
* be immersed in  沉浸于
* misconceptions  误解，错误观念
* academic 学术的
* genre （文学 艺术 音乐等）种类，类型
* mystery 悬疑类
* fantasy 奇幻类
* literally 确实的，真正的，实际上

to be honest, i also read a lot of things that i don't remember, or things that just didn't leave an impression on me, but every once in a while, there is something i read that totally blows my mind or it moves me or it changes my perspective on something and that's why i think reading is so important.
* but every once in a while  但总会有那么一刻
* blows my mind 让我大吃一惊

there are books that i read as a kid that i still think about to this day, because it impacted me so much, for example, i read the book《the book thief》 when i was a kid, and it was the first book that made me cry while reading it, and the story really made me appreciate the things that i might have taken for granted in life.
* to this day 直到今天
* take … for granted  认为…理所当然
  * We often take for granted the clean water that comes out of our taps.（我们常常把水龙头里流出的干净水视为理所当然。）
  * Don't take your health for granted; take good care of yourself.（别把健康视为理所当然，好好照顾自己。）
  * She took for granted all the efforts her parents made for her.（她把父母为她付出的所有努力都当作理所当然。 ）

so besides all the benefits of reading that people always talk about, like “it's good for your brain” or “you can expand the vocabulary”, whatever. for me, the most important benefit that people never talk about is that it can build empathy. through reading, you get attached to characters and you can really understand their unique situations in life, because you're literally reading their thoughts, so you care about their general well-being and if something bad happens to them, it really has an impact on you.i think this translates over to the real world as well.
* whatever 等等之类的
* empathy 同理心，强调感同身受  sympathy 侧重同情，表达对他人的不幸感到难过
* get attached to  对…产生依恋
* character
  * （书、戏剧、电影等中的）人物，角色：如The novel has many interesting characters.（这部小说里有许多有趣的人物。）
  * 性格；个性：常用于描述人的特质。例He has a strong character.（他个性很强。）
  * 特点；特征：指事物的独特属性。如The city has its own unique character.（这座城市有其独特的特点。）
  * （书写或印刷）符号；文字：尤指汉字、字母等。如Chinese characters（汉字）
* “well - being” 是一个固定名词短语，“being” 在此处与 “well” 构成这个特定词汇，用于表达某人或某物的状态。“being” 本身有 “存在；生存；状态” 等含义，在 “well - being” 中，强调的是一种良好的生存、生活状态，也就是“幸福；安康” 。
* translate over to 延伸到，应用到

so the more that people read, the more they might find that they're caring about people around them in real life, whether that be friends, family or even strangers, because just imagine how much nicer the world would be, if we all really cared about each other and just had a little bit more empathy.
* a little bit：是一个短语，用来修饰形容词或副词的比较级

with all that being said, i just want to say that you don't have to like reading, it's really okay if you don't like it, i mean, it's literally just a hobby and not everyone's gonna like doing that hobby, and it doesn't mean that you're not smart or anything like that.and if you want to get into reading，i recommend finding a story that you're actually interested in and spending maybe 10 to 20 minutes a very short period of time reading in a day， but don't feel stressed if you can't remember everything you're reading，the main point is just to have fun in the moment and over time you'll be able to see the real benefits of reading。
* with all that being said  说了这么多
* recommend doing sth 建议做某事
* over time 随着时间的推移
* it's literally just a hobby and not everyone's gonna like doing that hobby.为什么用that
  * 指代距离感：“that”常带有一定的距离感，可指在空间、时间或心理上稍远的事物。这里前文已提及阅读这一爱好，用“that hobby”，有种与当前讨论稍拉开距离，泛化“爱好”概念的感觉，暗示“不是每个人都会喜欢（刚刚提到的）那种爱好” 。
  * 习惯表达：当再次提及前文已明确的事物时，用“that”指代较为常见，符合英语语言习惯，能自然地延续话题，使表达更流畅。而“this”通常用于指离说话者较近、当下正关注的事物，在此处语境中，“that”更契合整体表达。
* “get into”是一个常见的短语动词，具有多种含义，以下是一些常见的用法及示例：
  * 进入（某种状态或情况）：常用来表示开始处于某种情绪、状态或情形之中。例如“She got into a bad mood after hearing the news.（她听到这个消息后就陷入了坏情绪。）”
  * 参与、卷入（活动、事件等）：表示参与到某个活动、事情或麻烦当中。如“Don't get into trouble at school.（不要在学校惹麻烦。）”
  * 对……产生兴趣、开始从事：指开始对某个事物感兴趣或开始从事某项活动、工作等。例如“He got into painting when he was young.（他年轻时就开始对绘画感兴趣/从事绘画。）”
  * 穿上（衣服等）：用于描述穿上衣物等。例如“It's cold outside. Get into your coat.（外面很冷。穿上你的外套。）”
  * 到达（某个地方）：表示到达某个地点。例如“When did you get into Beijing?（你什么时候到达北京的？）”
