What does it mean to be loved? it might seem like a simple question, but it can actually be pretty complicated. so how do we express love to other people and how do we know when other people are expressing their love to us?
1. but it can actually be pretty complicated.
   * pretty complicated 相当复杂

Hi, everyone, i'm sure a lot of people have been watching this show.《再见爱人》. I've also been watching and following along, and this show has not only made me think about my own relationship, but also reflect on love as a whole. so i wanted to share some of my thoughts with you today. of course, there have been some really shocking parts in this show. and even for me hearing the phrase “我配拥有一杯咖啡吗？”. If someone said that to me, i’d just be like, do you want it or not? like, tell me directly, i don't want to play these guessing games. so yes, it does feel very weird even for me to hear that phrase. but the thing that this show has made me think the most about is the different ways that people show love. 

for example, there have been many times throughout the show when maimai is saying, she wants to feel loved, she wants to feel taken care of. but i do feel like her husband shows love and many different ways, like flying to different cities to bring back her favorite foods. even if she doesn't like all of the flavors, she doesn't like all of the food, I still think it's very clear that that's his way of showing love. as viewers, it's very obvious that that's his way of showing love and he does love her a lot. and honestly, i don't know that many guys in real life who would be willing to do the same thing for another girl. but for maimai, it just might not be the way she expects to get love, or somehow she might not even realize that that's his way of showing love.

1. i'm sure a lot of people have been watching this show.《再见，爱人》 我确信很多人一直在观看《再见，爱人》这个节目。
   * have/has been + 现在分词 表示现在完成进行时，它强调动作从过去某一时间开始，一直持续到现在，并且可能还会继续下去。
2. and this show has not only made me think about my own relationship but also reflect on love as a whole. 而且这个节目不仅让我思考我自己的感情关系，还让我从整体上反思爱情”。
   * make sb do sth  使某人做某事
3. reflect on  反省、回顾、思考
   * It is important to reflect on your long-term goals from time to time.（时常反思自己的长期目标是很重要的。）
   * from time to time 不时、偶尔、有时 同义词有
     * occasionally”（偶尔）
     * “now and then”（时而；不时）
     * “at times”（有时）
4. so i wanted to share some of my thoughts with you today. 这句话中want为什么要用过去式
   * “want”使用过去式“wanted”可能有以下原因：
     * 表述过去的想法
       * 如果说话者是在回忆过去某个具体时刻或阶段的想法，就会用过去式“wanted”。例如，在描述昨天参加完一个讲座后，当时有一些感悟想和对方说，就可以用“So I wanted to share some of my thoughts with you today”来引出当时的想法。
     * 与整体语境的时态一致
       * 当整个交流语境是在叙述过去发生的事情或情况时，为了保持时态一致，也会使用“wanted”。比如在讲述一段过去的旅行经历时，说到在旅途中看到了一些有趣的事物，然后接着说“So I wanted to share some of my thoughts with you today”，这里使用过去式与前面叙述旅行的过去时态相呼应。
     * 表达委婉或客气
       * 在某些情况下，使用过去式可以使语气更加委婉、客气。用“wanted”而不是“want”，会让表达显得不那么直接和强硬，有一种试探性或谦逊的感觉，好像在说“我之前有这样的想法，不知道你是否愿意听”。
5. If someone **said** that to me, i’d just be like, do you **want** it or not? 这句话中someone said为什么要用过去式，后面的want it or not 为什么又不用过去式<!-- {"fold":true} -->
   * someone said使用过去式的原因
     * 描述假设情景：在这个句子中，“If someone said that to me”是一个虚拟的假设情景，是在设想过去如果有人对自己说这句话会怎样，而不是正在发生或经常发生的事情，所以用过去式“said”来表示这种与现在实际情况相反的假设。
     * 口语表达习惯：在英语口语中，当人们用“if”来表达一种假设或想象的情况时，常常会使用过去式，这是一种比较自然的口语习惯，使表达更具委婉性或不确定性
   * want it or not不用过去式的原因
     * 直接引语的影响：“do you want it or not”是在假设情景中直接引用自己可能会说的话，是一种直接引语的形式。在直接引语中，通常会根据实际表达的需要使用相应的时态，而不受前面假设从句中过去式的限制，这里是在表达一种当下直接的询问或反应，所以用一般现在时。
     * 强调一般性情况：使用一般现在时“want”可以强调这种反应是一种普遍的、一般性的情况，而不仅仅局限于过去那个假设的时刻。即无论过去还是现在，如果遇到这样的情况，自己都会这样直接回应，有一种“一贯如此”的意味。
6. there have been some really shocking parts in this show. 这个节目里有一些着实令人震惊的部分。
   * shock parts 震惊的部分
7. tell me directly, i don't want to play these guessing games.
   * guessing games  猜谜游戏，猜测性的游戏
8. it does feel very weird even for me to hear that phrase. 即使对我来说，听到这句话也感觉很奇怪
   * 当使用“it”作形式主语表示“做某事是……的”时，常用“it is + 形容词 + to do sth.”的结构，其中“to do sth.”是真正的主语，这是一种比较固定的句式，所以用“to hear”符合这种常见的语法结构。
9. “be willing to do the same thing for another girl”
   * be willing to do sth 固定搭配，愿意做某事

Let me share an example from my own personal life of how different people show love in different types of ways. so for me, when i'm at home, i always tie my hair up with these claw clips, but my hair is really thick and really heavy, so they break really easily. and just the other day i broke another one, it just completely broke apart when i was trying to put it in my hair. So i shared this with my boyfriend. i just thought it was kind of funny. you know, i broke another one again, but he remembered this and a few days later he came back with a bunch of new claw clips and i never asked him to do that and i didn't mention it after i just said that one time. but for him, that's his way of showing his love for me. so it might not sound like such a big deal, but it is an example of how he shows his love for me and it tells me that he really thinks about me and he really has me deep in his heart. and these little things can often be overlooked. but i personally think it's one of the true ways to know that you’re loved, ~~even with Gexi~~.

* and just the other day i broke another one,
  * the other day 不久前的某一天，前几天
* it just completely broke apart when i was trying to put it in my hair.
  * “broke apart”是固定短语，意思是“破碎，破裂，散开”，在这里作谓语，描述物品的状态变化。
* he came back with a bunch of new claw clips
  * “with”是介词，在这里表示伴随的状态或携带的物品等情况。
  * “a bunch of”是一个常用短语，意为“一束；一串；一堆；大量的”，用来修饰后面的名词，起数量限定的作用。
* i didn't mention it after i just said that one time<!-- {"fold":true} -->
  * “after”是连词，引导时间状语从句，说明主句动作发生在从句动作之后，在这里表示“在……之后”的时间关系。
  * “i just said that one time”是由“after”引导的时间状语从句，其中“i”是从句主语，“just”为副词，修饰动词“said”，强调“仅仅，只是”；“said”是“say”的过去式，意为“说”；“that one time”表示“那一次”，整体说明在那仅有的一次说过之后，就没再提及了。
  * what  I said that one time. 我那次说过的话  that one time  那一次
* it tells me that he really thinks about me and he really has me deep in his heart.
  * ￼￼think about 考虑，想着
  * deep in sb heart  在某人内心深处
* and these little things can often be overlooked. 
  * overlook 忽略，忽视
* but i personally think it's one of the true ways to know that you’re loved.
  * i personally think 我认为
  * it’s one of the true ways to know that  sth 这是了解……的真实方式之一
* so it might not sound like such a big deal  这听起来没什么大不了的
  * such a big deal 如此重大的事、这么大一件事
I strongly remember the scene where she says she wants to ask her husband “你爱过我吗?”，especially because she used "过". so when i heard this, i was kind of confused and a little bit shocked honestly, because i didn't really understand how two people can get married and stay together for so long without any love at all. i think in every relationship there needs to be a period of taking time to understand each other and i don't mean just learning facts about your partner, like, when’s their birthday? how many siblings do they have? stuff like that. I mean really deeply trying to understand who they are as a person. and i think if both people really understand each other, it makes communication way way easier. 

* I strongly remember the scene where she says she wants to ask her husband
  * strongly remembers the scene  清楚的记得那个场景
* i think in every relationship **there needs to be** a period of taking time to understand each other  我认为在每一段关系中，都需要有一段花时间去相互了解的阶段。
  * a period 一段时间 一个阶段
  * 这是一个there be 句型，there不能去掉
* i don't mean just learning facts about your partner,
  * mean+名词/代词/动名词/从句 做宾语
* siblings 兄弟姐妹
* I mean really deeply trying to understand who they are as a person. 我的意思是真正深入地试着去了解他们作为一个人是怎样的。
  * really deeply  真正深入的
* it makes communication way way easier.
  * “way way easier”整体作宾语补足语，“way”在这里是副词，用于加强语气，两个“way”连用起到强调程度的作用，“easier”是形容词“easy”的比较级，说明使交流变得更加容易了。
  * 远远地；大大地；非常：用于加强比较级或最高级的程度，如“way too expensive”（太贵了）、“This book is way more interesting than that one.”（这本书比那本有趣得多。）

In America, we often talk about different “love languages” and these are just describing the different ways that people like to show and receive love. So in total there's five of them. there are words of affirmation, gift giving, quality time, physical touch and acts of service. for me, my love language is quality time, so i just like spending time with my partner, no matter what we're doing. on the other hand, my a boyfriend's love language is more like acts of service. So whether that be buying some new hair clips for me, or you know getting me a snack when i've had a bad day, or cooking me a nice meal, these are **the** ways that he shows his love for me. and these love languages don't only have to apply to romantic relationships. it's also good for understanding friends and family as well. 
* in total there's five of them  总共有5种
  * there be句型，be动词的形式是由紧跟其后的名词的单复数情况来决定的，在这里紧跟“be”动词的是“five”这个表示数量的词，它在概念上被当作一个整体来看待，相当于单数名词，所以用“is”而不是“are”来搭配，强调存在的是“五个（这样的事物）”这样一个整体数量概念。
* words of affirmation 肯定的言辞，赞美之词
* quality time 优质时间
* whether that be buying some new hair clips for me,
  * “whether...or...or...”构成并列结构，用来列举不同的情况，表示“不管是……还是……还是……”。在“whether that be...”这里用了虚拟语气的形式（原句严格语法上应该是“whether that should be...”省略了“should”），较为正式、文雅地提出多种假设情况。
* “romantic relationships”是宾语，指“恋爱关系”，说明适用的范围。

My main point is everyone is different and there’s no certain single way to show love for someone. love can show up in many different ways. it could be buying flowers on your way home from work or cutting up some fruit for your partner, holding hands or even just spending quality time together. so sometimes when i'm watching《再见爱人》，I do get frustrated by myself. I'm sure some of you also feel the same way, because some couples they really do need some more communication and not just that. you also have to sincerely listen to your partner and try to understand them. like for me, when maimai said, she's not willing to understand her husband, she doesn't wanna understand his inner world, she doesn't care about his hobbies. when i saw that my jaw literally dropped. 
* my main point   我的主要观点
* on sb/my way home from work 在某人下班回家的路上
* I do get frustrated  by myself  我确实对自己感到沮丧
  * frustrated  沮丧的
* I'm sure some of you also feel the same way
  * some of you 你们中的一些人
  * the same way 同样的方式、感受  
* because some couples they really do need some more communication and not just that.
  * some couples 一些情侣
  * not just that 不止如此
* sincerely 真诚的
* when i saw that my jaw literally dropped. 当我看到这个，我都惊掉了下巴
  * literally 确实，真的，简直，起强调作用，强调所说的事情真实发生，而非夸张

if my boyfriend said that about me, like didn't care about my hobbies, he didn't care about what i liked or my inner world, i would be so devastated, because that just means he doesn't care about me as a person. i'm getting mad just thinking about it. but i was very shocked to say the least, because in my opinion, at least trying to understand your partner is one of the main foundations in any relationship. but anyway these are just some of the things that this show made me think about and reflect on, and i think the next few episodes should be very interesting. so let me know your thoughts in the comments, let me know what you think your love language is, and i'll see you guys next time bye bye~

* i would be so devastated 我将会非常崩溃
  * devastated 崩溃，沮丧
* i'm getting mad just thinking about it.  “我光是想想这件事就开始生气了”。
  * “get”作系动词时，有“变得”“逐渐成为”的意思，“be getting + 形容词”是一种常用的结构，用于强调状态的逐渐变化过程。在这里用“getting”生动地体现出“我”从原本正常的情绪状态逐渐变得生气的过程，而不是突然一下子就生气了，更能传达出情绪的动态变化。
  * mad  “mad”常见释义为“疯狂的”“发疯的”“狂热的”“生气的”“愤怒的”等，此处是生气的意思
* but i was very shocked to say the least,
  * to say the least  至少可以说，退一步说
* foundation 基础的
* but anyway these are just some of the things that this show made me think about and reflect on.  但不管怎样，这些只是这部剧让我思考和反思的一部分内容”。
  * but anyway 但不管怎样
* episode  剧集
